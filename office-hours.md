# Office Hours

Office hours are generally from 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, always held in the student work area on the 8th floor. At least one instructor will be present. They're completely optional, but can be **extremely** useful!

Generally speaking:
- Joseph will be present on Monday.
- Matt will be present on Tuesday.
- Ritika will be present on Wednesday.

(These are subject to change but every attempt will be made to notify you ahead of time about any changes.)

The format is informal: the instructor "on duty" hangs out by the student work area, and if you get stuck, you can wander over and ask him/her a question. If everyone is having the same problem, the instructor may conduct an informal mini-lesson.
