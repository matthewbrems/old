# One-on-Ones

You will have the option to one-on-one with an instructor every 2 weeks, typically on Friday. Reach out to your instructors to schedule a time.

They're a space to talk about literally anything. One-on-ones might include:
- Code review
- Discussing concepts covered in class
- Talking about your career search
- Thinking through project ideas
- Generally shooting the breeze

**It's up to you** what gets covered during the one-on-ones, so please come with questions prepared!

One-on-ones are usually 15 minutes. They can be longer or shorter depending on what needs you express.

We're more than happy to help outside of explicit one-on-one time -- simply reach out.
