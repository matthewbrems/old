Below are the details for the positions - please reach out to Joseph, Matt or Lauren if you have additional questions! 

# DSIR @ GA

We want you! We're looking for our Data Science in Residence for the next upcoming DSI cohort. This is a chance for you to gain some valuable experience as part of the DSI instructional team.
#### *Please note: Training for this position would begin no later than June 5th*

DSI5 (Summer cohort) will begin June 19th and will end Sept 9th.

## Why teach the DSI?

If you are looking to make a life-changing impact by sharing your love for data science with the next generation of data scientists, we’d love for you to consider joining our team. We deliver more than just skills training and are looking for new grads who share our vision for a community of lifelong learners pursuing work that they love. As a full-time DSIR for our flagship full-time DSI program, you will join us to:

- Work closely with our co-instructors to guide students through a rigorous, transformational journey toward apprenticeship in data science.
- Become a better teacher, leader, and mentor as you learn from veteran instructors and our world-class instructional coaches.
- Inspire and support students as they identify their passions and drive their own continued learning beyond the curriculum.
- Adapt our global curriculum and use it to guide your teaching, building your own lesson plans as needed and contributing back your lessons learned over time.
- Facilitate a safe, supportive, and energetic community that welcomes the various needs and learning styles of your students.
- Shore up your own knowledge of the DSI curriculum in the process!

As a DSIR, you will be responsible for teaching, planning, mentoring, grading, and collaborating with other teams at General Assembly. (It is literally your job to continue your own education through sharing your knowledge with future students.)

**We're looking for applicants that are empathetic, excited to help others learn, and passionate about data science.** You're diligent, respectful, and a DSI graduate.

## Previous DSIRs

> "I couldn't have asked for a better way to solidify my grasp for the material. Working in a highly challenging but highly supportive (and rewarding!) environment is the best introduction to teaching I could have hoped for. I guess it was ok."
- Ritika Bhasker, DSIR @ DSI4

> The best job I have ever had.
> I found DSIR to be the most rewarding and enjoyable work I have ever done.  There is nothing like having the opportunity to teach someone about something you truly enjoy and watch them learn, grow and apply it in their own unique manner.  
> Some other perks: GA faculty are fantastic people who know how to have a good time.  - Theres like a free food bonus as well.; You get paid to learn more about what you enjoy; So much fun. Outrageous fun.
- Sam, DSIR @ DSI3

> Working alongside our instructional team gave me so much more confidence in the material. Teaching is the best way to learn, so I understood the concepts much more deeply after explaining them to others. I was also able to leverage my background in education to further develop General Assembly's data science curriculum. I enjoyed the experience so much that I've stayed involved with curriculum development and TA roles in GA's data science portfolio. I had a blast.
- Haley, DSIR @ DSI2
