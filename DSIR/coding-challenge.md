## DSIR Instructor Code Challenge

### Welcome! 

> Please review the dataset and answer the questions provided.

### Instructions! 

1. Please create a jupyter notebook and save your code in a github gist. 
2. In your notebook, create two markdown headings: `#Part 1` & `#Part 2`. 
3. For each part, complete the following challenges. 

> Note: Please take *no more than 8 hours* to complete both of these challenges.

#### [Part 1: Modeling](https://gist.github.com/jeff-boykin/ec951ccaa1f90470b6ccc2bb1315d28a)
A challenge to evaluate your ability to perform standard data science tasks in Python.

#### [Part 2: Feedback](https://gist.github.com/jeff-boykin/e5d82e79a3de29813ff745496e6cb5c1)
A challenge to evaluate your ability to review & debug student code while providing them with relevant feedback.

## Next Steps

When you're finished, please submit a link to your Jupyter notebook using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org) to render your gist. Afterward, one of our instructors or internal subject matter experts will review your submission and we'll follow up with you. Good luck!!
