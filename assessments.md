## Assessments

Throughout the course, we will gauge your progress and competency in a number of ways: labs, quizzes/exams, review presentations, projects, code reviews, and blog posts. In order to graduate, you must meet certain standards, mentioned below.

### 1. Labs
Labs will be the most common method of evaluation - there will be roughly seven to eight labs each week. It is our expectation that you complete each lab to the best of your ability. Each week, we will select approximately 2 labs to grade for accuracy/completeness and provide feedback accordingly. At the beginning of each week, we will let you know of one of the labs we will grade. **In order to graduate, you must satisfactorily complete 80% of these labs.**

### 2. Quizzes/Exams
For the first ten weeks, at the end of each week there will be either a short written quiz or a lengthier exam. In particular, weeks 1-4 and 6-9 will have a short quiz consisting of approximately 5 multiple choice and approximately 2 extended response questions. Week 5 will include a midterm exam and week 10 will include a final exam. While the exact exam format is not yet determined, students can expect it to be a similar mix of multiple choice and extended response questions. **In order to graduate, your quiz/exam average must meet or exceed 70% and you may not earn below a 60% on any quiz/exam.** You may petition in writing to retake quizzes two weeks after the original quiz date by contacting their squad leader. (There may be small adjustments to this throughout the cohort but any adjustments will be made through both verbal announcements and in writing.)

### 3. Review Presentations
During breakfast hour, you will give a fifteen minute presentation that reviews a concept that has already been taught. This presentation should be aimed at a non-technical audience and explain what the concept is, why it is relevant, its benefits and its drawbacks. We will film this and make a copy available to you so that you may include this on your personal site. **In order to graduate, you will do one review presentation.**

### 4. Projects
Each student will complete a series of projects designed to demonstrate mastery of the entire data science "pipeline" - from data collection to exploratory data analysis to modeling to writing up and presenting results. The requirements for each project will vary and be specified when each project is announced. While not every student will present every project, you must complete all projects and you will present multiple projects. **In order to graduate, you must complete each project satisfactorily and present each project to which you are assigned.**

### 5. Code Reviews
In data science, the ability to program effectively is as important as the ability to collaborate with and learn from others. A code review is the perfect opportunity to promote both. You will display your code to fellow students, walk through each line of code, and defend the choices you made when writing your code. Your classmates will have the opportunity to ask questions, to suggest changes, and to learn from what you did. **In order to graduate, you must do one code review.**

### 6. Blog Posts
Whereas advances in most academic areas is left to peer-reviewed journals, many advances in data science come from people posting research on blogs or personal sites. In fact, blogs are to data science as Twitter is to journalists. Many data scientists have blogs as a way to communicate interesting findings, code snippets that they have found to be particularly helpful or challenging, and discussions of "hot" data science topics. We believe that you keeping a blog is incredibly beneficial to your development as a data scientist. As such, you will be keeping a blog of your own with regular posts throughout the cohort. **In order to graduate, you must publish at least ten data science-related blog posts on a personal site.**
