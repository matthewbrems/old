Data Science Immersive | Project 2	 						

Your project will be assessed using the following standards, [derived from the data science workflow](../../../../resources/syllabus/DSI-workflow-v1.pdf):


- [ ] Identify problem
- [ ] Acquire Data
- [ ] Parse Data
- [ ] Mine Data
- [ ] Refine Data
- [ ] Model Data
- [ ] Present Results

Acceptable performance for these standards is based on how well you've performed the specific requirements listed below.

### Performance Evaluation
> Instructors: Mark boxes with 'X' or "n/a" if a section does not apply. Note that "Exceeds Expectations" (3pts) is really only applicable for student writeups or specially marked "*Bonus*" Options.

| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) | Exceeds Expectations (3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Identify: Write a detailed problem statement + Describe Goals & Criteria for Success | | | | |
| Acquire: Import with Pandas & create at least one exploratory plot | | | | n/a |
| Parse: State the risks & assumptions of your data | | | | n/a |
| Mine: Create necessary columns + Clean/format/process data | | | | n/a |
| Refine: Determine outliers + distribution, correlation, & statistical analysis | | | | *Bonus: handle outliers*  |
| Model: Create at least one linear model; calculate probabilities + evaluate model, perform cross-validation, describe bias-variance tradeoff| | | | *Challenging Bonus: perform Ridge and Lasso regularization and explain what they do* |
| Present: Create executive summary, present findings, summarize conclusions/recommendations, tailored for your audience (based on your scenario) | | | | *Bonus: Include additional data & improvement suggestions* |
| *Bonus! Present: Create blog post summary* | | | | |
