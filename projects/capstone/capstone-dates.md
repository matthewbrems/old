## Overview

Your capstone is your opportunity to hone an independent data science problem, and use your skills from class (and beyond!) to produce a project.

The best capstones emphasize using data science to **solve a problem.** (That problem need not be financially motivated to be insightful.) Going through the motions of implementing various class methods without clear reason will not prove how you can use your new skills in a deliberate, thoughtful manner.

The general flow to creating a capstone is the following:

- Define a problem statement
- Identify data sources
- EDA
- Build a model
- (Deploy if necessary)
- Write-up

## Deliverables

You have three key deliverables:

- A cleaned Jupyter notebook documenting your process
- A blog post that can be read by any audience to learn why what you did is useful
- A presentation for an technically-inclined audience (this presentation can dip into model details but should be approachable by all)

## Problem Statements

A good problem statement explicitly declares the thesis of what you hope your work will produce. The data sources, problem to be solved, and result that determine success are very clear.

For example:

```
Based on the text summaries of legislative bills from the 115th Congress, predicting the probability that any given bill will pass.
```

## Timeline

A timeline that will continue to be updated is below. Bolded dates imply in-class action is required.
