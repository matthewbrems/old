## Visualization Resources

Takeaways from Matt's lesson:
1. Visualizations effectively convey information, so use them *frequently!*
2. However, visualizations can detract from your point if a visualization doesn't have a specific purpose, so use them *intentionally!*
3. Visualizations during your exploratory data analysis (EDA) process will help to give you a clear idea about what your data look like and can alert you to anomalies in your data that summary statistics may not uncover.
