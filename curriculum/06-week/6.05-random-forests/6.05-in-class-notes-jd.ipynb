    "## Introduction to Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, decision trees are very powerful machine learning models. Random forests, a step beyond decision trees are very widely used classifiers and regressors. They are relatively simple to use because they require very few parameters to set and they perform pretty well. Glossing over the finer details, for right now we'll think of random forests as bagged decision trees. (We'll see shortly that this isn't precisely correct, but that this is a good way to think about random forests for now.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** What are the main advantages of decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand decision trees have some limitations. In particular, trees that are grown very deep tend to learn highly irregular patterns (a.k.a. they overfit their training sets). Bagging (bootstrap aggregating) helps to mitigate this problem by exposing different trees to different sub-samples of the whole training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-69838e874a74b9537c2540c65dbea725)\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are a method of further averaging multiple deep decision trees, trained on different parts of the same training set, with the goal of reducing the variance. This comes at the expense of a small increase in the bias and some loss of interpretability, but generally greatly boosts the performance of the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![www.cse.buffalo.edu/~jing/sdm10ensemble.htm](./assets/images/Ensemble.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** Describe how the bagging algorithm works.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Random forests_ differ from bagging decision trees in only one way: they use a modified tree learning algorithm that selects, at each candidate split in the learning process, a **random subset of the features**. This process is sometimes called _feature bagging_. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why might we do this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for doing this is the correlation of the trees in an ordinary bootstrap sample: if one or a few features are very strong predictors for the response variable (target output), these features will be selected in many of the bagging base trees, causing them to become correlated. By selecting a random subset of the features at each split, we counter this correlation between base trees, strengthening the overall model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a problem with $p$ features, it is typical to use:\n",
    "- $\\sqrt{p}$ (rounded down) features in each split for a classification problem.\n",
    "- $p/3$ (rounded down) with a minimum node size of 5 as the default for a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is a rule-of-thumb, Hastie and Tibshirani (authors of Introduction to Statistical Learning and Elements of Statistical Learning) have suggested this as a good rule-of-thumb in the absence of a rationale to do something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extremely Randomized Trees\n",
    "Adding one further step of randomization yields extremely randomized trees, or _ExtraTrees_. These are trained using bagging (sampling of observations) and the random subspace (sampling of features)method, like in an ordinary random forest, but an additional layer of randomness is introduced. Instead of computing the locally optimal feature/split combination (based on, e.g., information gain or the Gini impurity), for each feature under consideration, a random value is selected for the split. This value is selected from the feature's empirical range (in the tree's training set, i.e., the bootstrap sample), in other words, the top-down splitting in the tree learner is randomized."

    "## Intro to Boosting (15 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "With bagging and random forests we train models on separate subsets and then combine their prediction. In a sense we are parallelizing the training and then combining (like a map-reduce).\n",
    "\n",
    "_Boosting_ is a different ensemble technique that is _sequential_.\n",
    "\n",
    "![BoostingBagging](./assets/images/BoostingVSBagging.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is an iterative procedure that adaptively changes the sampling distribution of training records at each iteration in order to correct the errors of the previous iteration of models. The first iteration uses uniform weights (like bagging) for all samples. In subsequent iterations, the weights are adjusted to emphasize records that were misclassified in previous iterations. The final prediction is constructed by a weighted vote (where the weights for a base classifier depends on its training error).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the base classifier's focus more and more closely on records that are difficult to classify as the sequence of iterations progresses, they are faced with progressively more difficult learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting takes a base _weak_ learner and tries to make it a _strong_ learner by re-training it on the misclassified samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several algorithms for boosting, in particular we will mention `AdaBoost` and `GradientBoostingClassifier` that are implemented in scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "`AdaBoost` refers to a particular method of training a boosted classifier. A boost classifier is a classifier in the form $F_T(x) = \\sum_{t=1}^T f_t(x)$ where each $f_t$ is a weak learner that takes an object $x$ as input and returns a real valued result indicating the class of the object. These weak learners are aggregated to make a strong classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This presentation](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/vip/teach/MLcourse/4_boosting/slides/gradient_boosting.pdf) visually shows an example of AdaBoost at work and how AdaBoost laid the groundwork for Gradient Boosting Classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting Classifier is a generalization of boosting to arbitrary differentiable loss functions. The intuition behind this mechanism is to:\n",
    "- Fit a model $F$ to the data.\n",
    "- Look at the difference between our observed $y$ and our model $F$. (The $y_i - F(x_i)$ can be thought of as residuals!)\n",
    "- Fit a second model $F_2$ to (roughly) the residuals $y_i - F(x_i)$.\n",
    "- Aggregate your model $F$ and $F_2$.\n",
    "While we won't get into the details here, we can interpret residuals as negative gradients. By doing this, we can apply our gradient descent algorithm to optimize our loss and generalize this to many loss functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "GBRT is an accurate and effective off-the-shelf procedure that can be used for both regression and classification problems. Gradient Tree Boosting models are used in a variety of areas including Web search ranking and ecology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of GBRT are:\n",
    "- Natural handling of data of mixed type (= heterogeneous features)\n",
    "- Predictive power\n",
    "- Robustness to outliers in output space (via robust loss functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages of GBRT are:\n",
    "- Scalability, due to the sequential nature of boosting it can hardly be parallelized."

    "In this class we learned about Random Forests, extremely randomized trees and boosting. They are different ways to improve the performance of a weak learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these methods will perform better in some cases, some better in other cases. For example, decision trees are more nimble and easier to communicate, but have a tendency to overfit. On the other hand, ensemble methods perform better in more complex scenarios, but may become very complicated and harder to explain. (This gets back to our discussion about prediction versus inference - only you and your stakeholders will recognize what balance to strike between these two!)\n",
