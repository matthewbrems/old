## Introduction

In this lab we'll practice regularization. The [data set](http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/salary.dat) originally [from here](http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/#salary) consists of salary data for 52 professors at a small college, categorized by gender, professor rank, highest degree, and years of service paired with salary.

### Learning objectives

- Practice working with categorical data and dummy variables
- Try to predict various features using the others
- Practice regularization and evaluating model fit
- Visualize your fits, plotting accuracies versus predictions

### Requirements

The data contains three categorical variables, each with two or three values: "sx", "dg", "rk". Your tasks are as follows.
* Create dummy variables for each categorical variables.
* Use pandas `value_counts()` to see the distributions of the data
* Use seaborn to make [violin plots](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/generated/seaborn.violinplot.html) of the salaries by variable

For each categorical variable:
* Fit a model to the entire data set without the dummy variables for that category (but include the others).
* Use pandas to select a subset of the data and fit a linear model to just that subset. For example, select just the male professors and fit a model
* Apply the model fit from one subset to the other subset and compare the goodness of fit scores.
* Do the same for the other variables, i.e. fit a model to the women professors and apply it to the men, again comparing the goodness of fit.
* Use regularization (e.g. Ridge Regression or Lasso) to fit a model on one subset and apply to the other, again looking at the goodness of fit. Did regularization improve the model fits?

Bonus exercises:
* Try to predict years served "yr" or years since degree "yd" from the salary data and other variables. Does regularization help in any of these cases?

#### Deliverable

A completed Jupyter notebook.
