## Learning objectives

- Identify overfitting, its causes, and ways to combat it
- Compare and contrast ridge and lasso regression, comprehending the mathematical intuition for each
- Implement Ridge and Lasso regressions in SKLearn

## Resources

- The [SKLearn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html) on generalized linear models introduces the fundamentals of regularization
- There are two videos from Stanford's statistical learning classes that are excellent resources. [Ridge regression (13min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSKzqb0EKS0&list=PL5-da3qGB5IB-Xdpj_uXJpLGiRfv9UVXI&index=6) and [Lasso regression (15min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5I1G1MfUmA&index=7&list=PL5-da3qGB5IB-Xdpj_uXJpLGiRfv9UVXI)
- Check Tibshirani's [original paper](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/lasso/lasso.pdf) on lasso regression 
- Student compiled notes from Andrew Ng's [regularization lecture](http://www.holehouse.org/mlclass/07_Regularization.html) in his machine learning class
