Get comfortable self-learning and seeing neural networks.

I recommend watching one video from the [Tensorflow Dev Summit](https://events.withgoogle.com/tensorflow-dev-summit/videos-and-agenda/#content)

I have three recommended options:
- Keynote (Jeff Dean)
- TensorFlow High-Level API (Martin Wicke)
- Wide & Deep Learning: Memorization + Generalization with TensorFlow (Heng-Tze Cheng)
