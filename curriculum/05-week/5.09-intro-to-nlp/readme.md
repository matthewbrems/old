Learning Objectives:
- We'll cover why NLP is important and growing
- We'll discuss key methods to process text: countvectorizer, TF-IDF, Ngrams, and stopwords
- Implement the above examples in sklearn

## Resources

- Check out this [Yelp blog post](http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2015/09/automatically-categorizing-yelp-businesses.html) how they completed a classification task (with over 1000 response variables!) using restaurant review text
- Always check documentation: [CountVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html), [HashingVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer.html), [TF-IDF](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html)
- A list of all stop-words is available [here](https://github.com/ga-students/DSI-DC-2/blob/master/curriculum/Week-05/5.04-nlp/stop-words.txt) h/t sleevillanueva
- Wikpedia's [feature hashing](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/DSI-course-materials/tree/master/curriculum/04-lessons/week-06/4.1-lesson) and [hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) is a great place to turn for more info on hashing
- I made use of Charlie Greenbacher's [Intro to NLP](http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/nlp/slides/intro.pdf), which he delivered at the [DC-NLP Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DC-NLP/) (join!)
- Wikipedia includes a [walkthrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) of TF-IDF
- We played with Google's [ngram tool](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=data+science&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cdata%20science%3B%2Cc0)
- A hilarious data scientist gone rogue used NLP and Eigenfaces (Eigenvalues for face recognition) [for Tinder](http://dataconomy.com/hacking-tinder-with-facial-recognition-nlp/)
- I referenced KPCB's 2016 internet trends. If you're into startups, check out [this massive, insightful deck](http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends)
