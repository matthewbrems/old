We'll be learning how to evaluate classification models. At the conclusion of this lesson, you will know:
- What true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives are
- What a confusion matrix is, and how to apply its use
- What receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are, and why they're useful
- How to apply ROC curves
