### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*
- Define and give examples of classification
- Explain kNN algorithm
- Build a K-Nearest Neighbors using the scikit-learn library


## Resources

- Scott Foreman-Roe's [breakdown](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html) (required) of the bias-variance tradeoff featuring a discussion of KNN is an excellent read
- A [detailed discussion](https://saravananthirumuruganathan.wordpress.com/2010/05/17/a-detailed-introduction-to-k-nearest-neighbor-knn-algorithm/) of KNN
- A long, applied example of KNN applied to [image classification](http://cs231n.github.io/classification/ )
- If academic breakdowns are your thing, be sure to visit [this](http://me.seekingqed.com/files/intro_KNN.pdf) resource
- Read the SKLearn [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html) on implementing KNN
- Choosing the right [algorithm from SKLearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/)
- A deeper dive into [Euclidian distance](http://www.econ.upf.edu/~michael/stanford/maeb4.pdf)
- Classifier comparsion from [SKLearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html) (this is also in our [repository](https://github.com/ga-students/DSI-DC-2/blob/master/curriculum/Week-04/4.01%20Intro%20to%20Classification/classification-methods.py))
