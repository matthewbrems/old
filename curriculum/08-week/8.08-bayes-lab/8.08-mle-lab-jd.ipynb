    "The presidential voting season was recently upon us, and what better way to celebrate it (lol), and our newfound understanding of Bayesian statistics by fusing the two together? In the 2012 last presidential electoral cycle, Nate Silver won acclaim (and some scorn from academia for the acclaim he garnered with work that lacked much novelty) for utilizing a Bayesian approach to his poll prediction, in particular he utilized something called a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC). We're going to start our nascent political data science careers in this lab with something slightly less ambitious, but no less relevant to the material we've gone through so far."
