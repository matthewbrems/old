## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
- Explain Bayes Theorem from a review standpoint, and how Bayesian statistics better informs our predicted probabilities
- Intuitively explain how Bayes Theorem can be appropriated into a modeling tactic, Naive Bayes
- Implement Naive Bayes in sklearn
- Discuss assumptions and advantages/disadvantage of NB as a classifier




Our code implementation is intentionally light -- you will be building multiple NB models in the lab.
