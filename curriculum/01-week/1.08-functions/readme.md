### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*
- Review basic programming concepts (control flow)
- Create functions
- Lightly introduce numpy

## Opening and Review

Over the last few days we've gone over quite a bit of python.

- Integers, floats, strings
- Arithmetic operators, string operators
- Variable assignment
- Lists and dictionaries, operations on both
- If, if/else, loops, iteration
- Introduction to functions

## Functions Recap

Remember that functions:
- take inputs (or arguments).
- return outputs.
- use `return` instead of `print`.
- are used frequently to make coding more efficient.

Best practices with functions:
- Write comments.
- Write the body (inside) of the function first, then define the function and its arguments.
- Write comments.
- Start small. Rather than attempting to write the entire function at one time, think logically about what you need to do and write each step out. Check your code after each step to make sure what you believe is happening is actually happening!
- Write comments.
- Before production, try to break it. Put in positive and negative numbers, strings, dictionaries, lists, blanks - see what breaks and how you can fix it.
- COMMENTS.
- Start by getting the answer, then try to get that answer more quickly.
- For the love of everything that is good in this world, write comments!

## Creating Functions Together

We're going to walk through creating a few functions together.
