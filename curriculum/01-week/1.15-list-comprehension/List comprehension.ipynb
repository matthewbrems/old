    "## Introduction: Lambda Functions and List Comprehensions  (5 mins)\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Check:</strong> What does a lambda function do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions allow you to create small, anonymous functions that can be used wherever the function objects are required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python list comprehensions are a simple and powerful syntax that allow for fast, efficient, and intuitive manipulation of array-like data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though list comprehensions may seem confusing at first, they are easy to get used to and once understood make otherwise complex code readable and concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are essentially replacements for iteration control statements. I will explain why this is the case below, and give the non-list-comprehension alternative code to help you understand what they are doing (and make it clear why they are so much better!). \n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"List Comprehension Basics\"></a>\n",
    "## Refresher: Lambda Functions (10 mins)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we'd said earlier, lambda functions can be used wherever the function objects are required. The syntax of lambda functions is lambda argument_list: expression \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = lambda x, y : x + y\n",
    "f(\"totally \", \"awesome\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's walk through a couple of common uses for the lambda function:\n",
    "\n",
    "With for loops, iterating through a list and adding 1 to every single item should be easy to walk through:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n",
    "\n",
    "nums_plus_one = []\n",
    "for x in numbers:\n",
    "  nums_plus_one.append(x+1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this more concisely using lambda along with the map() function\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n",
    "nums_plus_one = map(lambda x: x+1, numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All this is doing is going through every single item in the numbers list, adding 1 to that item, and then saving it to a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, let's say we want pull out all the even numbers from our list of numbers. We can do this using lambda with the filter() function \n",
    "```python\n",
    "only_evens = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is iterating through every item in the numbers list, checking if the remainder when the item is divided by 2 is 0, and then saving it to a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guided Practice: List Comprehension Basics (20 mins)\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow along for the demos in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "[python guided practice notebook]('./code/w1-5.1-list-comprehensions-demo.ipynb')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What are list comprehensions?\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are statements that perform some kind of operation on each element of a list, and allow us to combine the readability of for loops with the conciseness of lambda functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's keep working with the array of numbers we already have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using list comprehension, a statement that adds 1 to every item of a list would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nums_plus_one = [x+1 for x in numbers]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go over how that works in more granular detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=https://datasciencelab.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/list1.jpg?w=830>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Like the map statement, nums_plus_one is assigned on the left as a new variable.\n",
    "- List comprehensions return a list, and the internal statement is wrapped in the list brackets: [...]\n",
    "- Within the brackets these elements are similar to a for loop:\n",
    "  1. The **operation per element** comes first: x+1\n",
    "  2. Next is the **for loop variable assignment**: for x\n",
    "  3. Last comes the **list of elements to iterate over**: in numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conditional logic in list comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions can be extended to cover more of the functionality of a for loop than just an operation over elements. Let's say we wanted to \"binarize\" a variable based on whether the elements are greater or less than the mean over all elements. The for loop could look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "n = [1, 2, 7, 21, 3, 1, 62, 3, 34, 12, 73, 44, 12, 11, 9]\n",
    "n_bin = []\n",
    "n_mean = np.mean(n)\n",
    "for x in n:\n",
    "  if x >= n_mean:\n",
    "    n_bin.append(1)\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "    n_bin.append(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's pretty verbose. A list comprehension can do the same thing much easier:\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary> 2-A) Binarize numbers:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "n = [1, 2, 7, 21, 3, 1, 62, 3, 34, 12, 73, 44, 12, 11, 9]\n",
    "n_mean = np.mean(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "</summary>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "n_bin = [1 if x >= n_mean else 0 for x in n]\n",
    "[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can even do chained conditionals! This statement swaps 1s to 0s and vice versa in a list, otherwise sets the items to none:\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary> 2-B) Swap 1s & 0s\n",
    "```python\n",

    "## Guided Practice: Advanced List Comprehensions (30 mins)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Nested List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "As some of you may have suspected by now, we can embed list comprehensions within other list comprehensions for even more power.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want the square and the square root for every non-negative element in a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary> 3-A) Square and square roots\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "n = [0, 1, 50, -23, -1, 75, -3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "</summary>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "math_pairs = [[x**2, np.sqrt(x)] for x in [y for y in n if y >= 0]]\n",
    "[[0, 0.0], [1, 1.0], [2500, 7.0710678118654755], [5625, 8.6602540378443873]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the if statement in the embedded list comes _after_ the in statement in this example. When your condition is meant to be a filter the conditional comes after.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### List Comprehensions with Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also do operations on multiple lists at the same time. I often use the **zip** and **enumerate** functions in combination with list comprehensions. First let's go over what each of the functions does.\n",
    "\n",
    "**zip** goes through each element of two lists iteratively at the same time:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = ['burrito','nachos','quesadillas','tamales']\n",
    "z = ['$8.99','$6.99','$5.99','$4.99']\n",
    "\n",
    "zipped = []\n",
    "for a_i, z_i in zip(a, z):\n",
    "    zipped.append([a_i, z_i])\n",
    "\n",
    "[['burrito', '$8.99'], ['nachos', '$6.99'], ['quesadillas', '$5.99'], ['tamales', '$4.99']]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check** Do this as a list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**enumerate** keeps track of the index of each element of a list:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = ['burrito','nachos','quesadillas','tamales']\n",
    "\n",
    "enumerated = []\n",
    "for i, a_i in enumerate(a):\n",
    "  enumerated.append([i, a_i])\n",
    "\n",
    "[[0, 'burrito'], [1, 'nachos'], [2, 'quesadillas'], [3, 'tamales']]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check** Do this as a list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep note that that with enumerate the index is returned first and the element second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's multiply the element of the first list by the index, then divide that by the element of the second list:\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary> 4-C) Comprehensions, enumerate, and zip\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list_one = [10, 15, 20, 25, 40]\n",
    "list_two = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "</summary>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "math_comp = [(x*i)/y for i, (x, y) in enumerate(zip(list_one, list_two))]\n",
    "[0, 7, 13, 18, 32]\n",
    "```\n",
    "</details>\n",

    "\n",
    "**Check:** Does anyone understand how this is working?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a complicated list comprehension with nested for loops, and brings up one of the more confusing aspects of list comprehensions. To understand let's first write out the comprehension more explicitly:\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's look at this in a for loop:\n",
    "\n",
