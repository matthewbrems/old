## Introduction

From previous days, you're already familiar with:

- Fundamental python concepts
- Iteration and looping
- Manipulation of dictionaries and lists
- Functions

Today we've added a lot more concepts on top of that:

- Numpy and scipy statistics functions
- Basic statistical concepts on descriptive statistics and distributions

In this lab you're going to combine everything we've learned so far... and reading in csv files with Python!

#### Requirements

- Load the "sales_data.csv" with python
- Construct a dictionary version of the data, with keys as column names and values as column data
- Write a function to describe measures of central tendency and measures of spread for the data
- Plot the data distributions and think about the skewness (or symmetry) of the data.

#### Starter Code

Here is the [dataset](./data/sales_data.csv) and here is your [starter code notebook](./code/1.12-starter-code.ipynb).
