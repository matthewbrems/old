- Explain for loop
- Demonstrate how to define functions

<a name="Control Flow"></a>
## Introduction: What is a condition? (10 mins)

We will go through an example of conditions on the board with [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode).

It is very important to control program execution because real situations are full of conditions and if you want your program to mimic the real world you need to transform those real world situations into your program. For this, you need to control the execution of your program statements. Controlling the program execution sequence is commonly known as [control flow](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/663666/Python-Basics-Understanding-The-Flow-Control-State).


<a name="if, if/else"></a>
## Demo / Guided Practice: if, if/else (15 mins)
The general Python syntax for a simple if statement is:
```bash
if condition:
    indentedStatementForTrueCondition
```

It's pretty simple: If the condition is true, then do the indented statements. If the condition is not true, then skip the indented statements.

Let's open up Python.

In your Python editor (command line, Spyder, Jupyter notebook, or iPython notebook) type:
```bash
weight = float(input("How many pounds does your suitcase weigh? "))
if weight > 50:
        print("There is a $25 charge for luggage that heavy.")
print("Thank you for your business.")
```

then type:
```bash
43
```

and it returns:
```bash
Thank you for your business.
```

Do it again, but this time put in a number > 50.

and it returns:
```bash
There is a $25 charge for luggage that heavy.
Thank you for your business.
```

The general Python if-else syntax is

        if condition:
            indentedStatementForTrueCondition
        else:
            indentedStatementForFalseCondition

These statement blocks can have any number of statements, and can include about any kind of statement.

In your Python editor type:
```bash
temperature = float(input('What is the temperature? '))
```

Input a temperature.

then type:
```bash
if temperature > 70:
    print('Wear shorts.')
else:
    print('Wear long pants.')
print('Get some exercise outside.')
```
The middle four lines are an if-else statement. There are two indented blocks: One, like in the simple if statement, comes right after the if heading and is executed when the condition in the if heading is true. In the if-else form this is followed by an else: line, followed by another indented block that is only executed when the original condition is false. In an if-else statement, exactly one of two possible indented blocks is executed.

Play around using numbers that are greater than 70 and less than 70.

**Check**: What is the general syntax for an if statement? an if/else?

<a name="if/elif/else"></a>
## Demo / Guided Practice: if/elif/else (15 mins)
The syntax for an if-elif-else statement is indicated in general below:

    if condition1:
        indentedStatementBlockForTrueCondition1
    elif condition2:
        indentedStatementBlockForFirstTrueCondition2
    elif condition3:
        indentedStatementBlockForFirstTrueCondition3
    elif condition4:
        indentedStatementBlockForFirstTrueCondition4
    else:
        indentedStatementBlockForEachConditionFalse

In your Python editor type:
```bash
x = int(raw_input("Please enter an integer: "))
```

Type in an integer.

then type:
```bash
if x < 0:
    x = 0
    print 'Negative changed to zero'
elif x == 0:
    print 'Zero'
elif x == 1:
    print 'Single'
else:
    print 'More'
```
The if, each elif, and the final else line are all aligned. There can be any number of elif lines, each followed by an indented block.

**Check**: How many indented blocks in an if/elif/else are executed?

<a name="loops"></a>
## Demo / Guided Practice: loops (15 mins)

Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.

The syntax for a for loop is indicated below:

    for iterator_name in iterating_sequence:
        statements

In your Python editor type:
```bash
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for w in words:
    print w, len(w)
```

and it returns:

```bash
cat 3
window 6
defenestrate 12
```

Knowledge check: what's happening here? Explain how the code returns what it does.

## Demo / Guided Practice: functions (15 mins)

- You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.
    - Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).
    - Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.
    - The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.
    - The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.
    - The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.

The syntax for a function is indicated in general below:

```bash
def functionname( parameters ):
   function_suite
   return [expression]
```

Let's create a function called printMe. In your editor type:

```bash
def printMe( str ):
   # This prints a passed string into this function
   print str
   return
```

now, let's call the function:

```bash
printMe("Beltway traffic makes my head hurt.")
printMe("It looks like a parking lot out there!")
```

and it returns:

```bash
Beltway traffic makes my head hurt.
It looks like a parking lot out there!
```

**Check** What’s the general syntax for a function? Why do you think functions might be useful?

## Independent Practice: Topic (10 minutes)
- What is the general syntax/format of:  
        - if/else?
        - if/elif/else?
        - loop?
        - function?
- Define and explain each to a partner

## Conclusion (5 mins)
Today we learned about if/else, if/elif/else, loops, and functions. Practice coding each until you feel comfortable. If you understand basic control flow concepts, you're on your way to writing fantastic executable programs!
