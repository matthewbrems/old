    "\n",
    "Autocorrelation makes explicit the idea of temporal correlation we discussed previously. Suppose we wanted to see how correlated a stock's prices are with the immediately preceding day's stock prices. You can think of two columns in a Pandas dataframe: one column with all stock prices, the other column with all stock prices adjusted by one day. The first row in this dataframe will consist of day 1 and day 2 stock prices, the second row in this dataframe will consist of day 2 and day 3 stock prices, and so on. Autocorrelation with a lag of 1 will calculate the correlation between these two columns. Autocorrelation with a lag of $k$ will calculate the correlation between stock prices and the stock prices of $k$ days before in a similar manner.\n",

In this case, I create a new column that takes the current day and $k-1$ previous days (for $k$ total days) and average the stock prices of these days.\n",
