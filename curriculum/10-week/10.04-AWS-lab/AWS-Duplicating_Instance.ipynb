    "**Snapshots** \n",
    "- Virtual machine snapshots are file-based snapshots of the state, disk data, and configuration of a virtual machine at a specific point in time. You can take multiple snapshots of a virtual machine, even while it is running. You can then revert the virtual machine to any of the previous states by applying a snapshot to the virtual machine.\n",
    ">- We can think of these as commits in git hub speak.  In the sense of we can revert our branch to a previous commits state.\n",
    ">- More about them here https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd851843(v=ws.11).aspx\n",
    "\n",
    "**Images** \n",
    "- A Disk image is a computer file containing the contents and structure of a disk volume or of an entire data storage device, such as a hard disk drive, tape drive, floppy disk, optical disc or USB flash drive. A disk image is usually made by creating a sector-by-sector copy of the source medium, thereby perfectly replicating the structure and contents of a storage device independent of the file system.\n",
    ">-If you remember back when we set up our AWS Instance there was an aspect of adding storage.  This is what we're making an image of, as this storage drive houses our OS and anything else we may have installed on our VM such as Anaconda or SQl Server.\n",
    "-----\n",
    "![What is Storage](images/aws_storage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    ">- When we launch our instance we select a default 'Amazon Machine Image'.  These are essentually disk images that Amazon has already taken with specific OS and maybe a few applications that they let everyone use.  \n",
    ">- Because Operating systems and applications are systems and series of files they need a storage device to be stored in as the RAM and CPU and/or GPU are not going to do this."
