For this lab, you are tasked with creating a Jupyter Notebook leveraging an AWS backend. You then have, at your disposal, a number of additional ways to set up your environment.

**Deliverable:** you are expected to create a Jupyter Notebook that runs using an EC2 instance.

There is a [walkthrough](./AWS-Jupyter_NB.ipynb) of how to do this in this folder.

For additional tips and tricks, consider linking EC2 and an S3 bucket. Alternatively, setup and play with the command line tutorial in the lessons folder.
