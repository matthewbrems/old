# Blogs

You will submit your ten blog posts via Github so the Outcomes team can check them off in Garnet.

To submit, add your link to the table below:

| Week          | Link to Blog 				 	|
| ------------- | ------------------------------|
| Week 1        | null (do not edit)			|
| Week 2        | null (do not edit)			|
| Week 3        | **link**      				|
| Week 4        | **link**      				|
| Week 5        | **link**      				|
| Week 6        | **link**						|
| Week 7        | **link**						|	
| Week 8        | **link**						|
| Week 9        | **link**						|
| Week 10       | **link**						|
| Week 11       | **link**						|
| Week 12       | **link**						|

If you have already written a blog post for week 2, simply make it be your week 3 blog post. Treat the week columns like slots, not explicit dates. Every week (slot) should have a link except for weeks 1 and 2.
