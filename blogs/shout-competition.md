## Suggestions from Joseph

I recommend making your blog post about 500-800 words. I'd focus on honing an insightful data narrative and make engaging visualizations. (Perhaps a useful reference: the code I've used for Medium visualizations is available on my [Github](https://github.com/josephofiowa/zenzic).)

A few examples:
- Vox's word count [piece](www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/12/16/13972394/most-common-words-hillary-clinton-speech) on the Hillary campaign
- Trump Won't Defy Midterm Gravity via [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-probably-wont-defy-midterm-gravity/)


Perhaps turn one of [these ten observations](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumpbeat-10-lessons-from-the-first-100-days/) into a fuller story.
